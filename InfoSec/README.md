## InfoSec Certification Prep
While you do not need a degree or a certification to get in the door to information security roles, it certainly does not hurt to have them.  CompTIA certifications tend to offer pretty good bang for your buck.  CompTIA certs start at $126 for fundamentals and go up to $466 for the advanced security practitioner test (CASP+).  Some certs may be needed for government infosec roles, the DoD has released [these requirements](https://public.cyber.mil/cw/cwmp/dod-approved-8570-baseline-certifications/)- known as DODD 8140 or DODD 8570- for certain roles relating to cybersecurity contracts and work within certain departments of the DoD.  These requirements may be cited when applying to cybersecurity roles at government contractors.  The CISSP is another certification that is often cited as a good standard within the industry.  Certifications are not innately valuable, they only serve as proof of minimum understanding of broad concepts and there is little value in chasing certifications unless you are interested in a role that requires them.
### CompTIA Security+ Exam
* [Professor Messer CompTIA Security+ SY0-601](https://www.professormesser.com/security-plus/sy0-601/sy0-601-video/sy0-601-comptia-security-plus-course/) The videos for this course are offered for free and contain pretty good information that appears on the test.  This is a good resource that covers just what is on the test and not much more
* [CompTIA Security+ SY0-501 Study Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XqZeBOM6JeR83Nce-k9aUkAZQV2denWs/view) This is a study guide for an older version of the Sec+ exam, but a lot of the information appears on the latest version of the test.
